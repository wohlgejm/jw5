title: About me
---

I'm a web developer with 10+ years experience, currently a Staff Engineer at [Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/).

For the past 6+ years, I've been working on [Stella Connect](https://stellaconnect.com/),
a B2B SaaS product for call centers. It's been really fun being a part of this product's
growth from MVP to over $10 million in ARR to a successful $100 million acquisition by
[Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/). While it's hard to attribute technology choices
to a product's success, I think a simple architecture that allows for iteration and
experimentation has played a non-trivial role in Stella's growth.

Before Stella, I cut my teeth at a small company called [WMC Global](https://www.wmcglobal.com/).
I started work as an analyst investigating fraud on mobile billing networks.
It was here that I started to learn how to program and after a short time started building
data-focused products for the company. This included an app to find fraud on ad networks
and an auditing tool for mobile billing ads.
