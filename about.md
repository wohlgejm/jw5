title: About me
---

I'm a web developer with **10+** years experience, currently a **Staff Engineer** at [Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/).

For the past 6+ years, I've been working on [Stella Connect](https://stellaconnect.com/),
a B2B SaaS product for call centers. It's been really fun being a part of this product's
growth **from MVP to over $10 million in ARR to a successful $100 million acquisition** by
[Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/). While it's hard to attribute technology choices
to a product's success, I think a simple architecture that allows for iteration and
experimentation has played a non-trivial role in Stella's growth.

Before Stella, I cut my teeth at a small company called [WMC Global](https://www.wmcglobal.com/).
I started work as an analyst investigating fraud on mobile billing networks.
It was here that I started to learn how to program and after a short time started building
data-focused products for the company. This included an app to find fraud on ad networks
and an auditing tool for mobile billing ads.

I did my studies in Policial Science and have a masters degree in it. My interests were focused
on the use of Twitter by political actors in the European Union. I've coauthored two papers
with tons of help from John Scherpereel, a professor at James Madison University.

- [The Adoption and Use of Twitter as a Representational Tool amount Members of the European Parliament](/img/eps_sws_published.pdf)
